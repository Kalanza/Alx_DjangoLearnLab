# Project Summary: Advanced Django API with Custom Serializers

## ✅ Task Completion Status: 100%

### 🎯 Objective Achieved
Successfully initiated a new Django project tailored for advanced API development with Django REST Framework, focusing on creating custom serializers that handle complex data structures and nested relationships.

## 📋 Completed Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Install Django and Django REST Framework
- ✅ Installed Django and Django REST Framework using pip
- ✅ Created Django project named `advanced_api_project` in the `advanced-api-project` directory
- ✅ Created Django app named `api`

### ✅ Step 2: Configure the Project
- ✅ Added `rest_framework` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in settings.py
- ✅ Added `api` app to `INSTALLED_APPS`
- ✅ Configured to use Django's default SQLite database

### ✅ Step 3: Define Data Models
- ✅ Created `Author` model with:
  - `name`: CharField for author's name
- ✅ Created `Book` model with:
  - `title`: CharField for book's title
  - `publication_year`: IntegerField for publication year
  - `author`: ForeignKey linking to Author model (one-to-many relationship)
- ✅ Defined models in `api/models.py`
- ✅ Successfully ran migrations to create models in database

### ✅ Step 4: Create Custom Serializers
- ✅ Created `BookSerializer` that serializes all fields of the Book model
- ✅ Created `AuthorSerializer` that includes:
  - The name field
  - Nested BookSerializer to serialize related books dynamically
- ✅ Added custom validation to BookSerializer to ensure publication_year is not in the future

### ✅ Step 5: Document Model and Serializer Setup
- ✅ Added detailed comments in `models.py` explaining purpose of each model
- ✅ Added detailed comments in `serializers.py` explaining purpose of each serializer
- ✅ Documented how the relationship between Author and Book is handled in serializers

### ✅ Step 6: Implement and Test
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive test suite with 8 test cases
- ✅ Used Django shell to manually test creating, retrieving, and serializing instances
- ✅ All tests pass successfully
- ✅ Verified serializers work as expected

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

### Models Architecture
```python
Author (1) ←─────→ (Many) Book
├─ name: CharField      ├─ title: CharField
└─ books: Related       ├─ publication_year: IntegerField
                        └─ author: ForeignKey
```

### Serializer Architecture
```python
AuthorSerializer
├─ name: Direct field
└─ books: Nested BookSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)

BookSerializer
├─ All Book fields (id, title, publication_year, author)
└─ Custom validation: validate_publication_year()
```

## 🧪 Testing Results

```

### Test Coverage
1. **Model Tests**: Author and Book creation and string representation
2. **Serializer Tests**: Nested relationships and custom validation
3. **API Endpoint Tests**: CRUD operations through REST API
4. **Validation Tests**: Future year validation (passes and fails correctly)

## 🌐 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/authors/` | List all authors with nested books |
| POST | `/api/authors/` | Create new author |
| GET | `/api/authors/<id>/` | Get author with nested books |
| PUT/PATCH | `/api/authors/<id>/` | Update author |
| DELETE | `/api/authors/<id>/` | Delete author |
| GET | `/api/books/` | List all books |
| POST | `/api/books/` | Create new book (with validation) |
| GET | `/api/books/<id>/` | Get specific book |
| PUT/PATCH | `/api/books/<id>/` | Update book (with validation) |
| DELETE | `/api/books/<id>/` | Delete book |

## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Custom Validation
- **Publication Year Validation**: Prevents books with future publication years
- **Error Message**: "Publication year cannot be in the future. Current year is 2025."

### 2. Nested Serialization
- **Author → Books**: Authors automatically include all their books in API responses
- **Dynamic Relationships**: Uses Django's `related_name='books'` for reverse lookup

### 3. Data Integrity
- **Unique Constraints**: Prevents duplicate books by same author
- **Cascade Deletion**: Deleting an author removes all their books
- **Foreign Key Relationships**: Proper relational database design

### 4. Documentation
- **Comprehensive Comments**: Every model and serializer thoroughly documented
- **README.md**: Complete setup and usage instructions
- **Test Documentation**: Full test suite with explanations

## 📊 Manual Testing Results

```python
=== Creating Authors ===
Created authors: J.K. Rowling, George Orwell

=== Creating Books ===
Created books: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (1997), 
               Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (1998), 
               1984 (1949)

=== Testing BookSerializer ===
Book serialized data: {'id': 1, 'title': "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", 
                      'publication_year': 1997, 'author': 1}

=== Testing AuthorSerializer with nested books ===
Author with nested books: {'id': 1, 'name': 'J.K. Rowling', 
                          'books': [{'id': 2, 'title': 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets', ...}]}

=== Testing Custom Validation (Future Year) ===
Validation failed as expected: {'publication_year': ['Publication year cannot be in the future...']}

=== Testing Valid Book Creation ===
Successfully created book: Animal Farm (1945)
```
